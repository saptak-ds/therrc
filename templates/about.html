              Every great competition needs a venue, and this website is the
              digital stadium for the Rendered Rivalry Cup. It's more than just
              a collection of pages; it's a high-performance engine meticulously
              engineered to deliver the complete tournament experience. The
              backend is powered by Flask, a swift and powerful Python framework
              that handles everything from complex fixture generation to
              real-time result processing with precision. All the drama‚Äîevery
              goal, every point, every penalty shootout‚Äîis securely stored and
              managed by a robust SQLite database. On the front lines, the
              entire user interface is crafted with Tailwind CSS, creating a
              clean, modern, and fully responsive design that looks sharp on any
              device, from a desktop monitor to the mobile screen where the
              games are actually played. This platform is a testament to a
              full-stack development philosophy, proving that powerful
              server-side logic and elegant front-end design can unite to create
              a seamless and immersive hub for players and viewers alike.

                  Hi... This is Saptak, and I'm the developer who built this
                  platform from the ground up. As a student in the BS in Data
                  Science and Applications program at IIT Madras, I believe the
                  best way to learn is by building. This tournament manager was
                  my way of taking classroom concepts and turning them into a
                  functional, real-world application. I'm driven by a passion
                  for technology and a desire to create clean, efficient, and
                  user-friendly software. This project is a showcase of my
                  skills in full-stack development, from the Python backend to
                  the responsive UI. I'm passionate about creating tools that are
                  both useful and enjoyable to use.
